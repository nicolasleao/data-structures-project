#+STARTUP: overview
#+TITLE: Data structure projects
#+CREATOR: Matheus Costa (macc)

* Project
** Description
   This project is divided in tree parts
- A presentation about Segment tree - an algorithm not seen in class
- A fully functional huffman algorithm, well documented
- Simple algorithm complexity comparison - Priority queues with and without Heaps

** Segmentation tree
- [[./docs/segtree-presentation.pdf][Segment tree Presentation]]
- [[https://visualgo.net/en/segmenttree?slide=1][Visualgo]]: A simple segtree vizualization.

** DONE Huffman
*** Usage

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ git clone https://github.com/projetosufal/data-structures-project
#+END_EXAMPLE
use make to build binaries
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ make
#+END_EXAMPLE
